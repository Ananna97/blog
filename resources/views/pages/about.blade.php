                      <p>Octarine, the colour of magic, the magical colour, it's...it's sort of...well, try describing mauve to the colour-blind. Most of us just have no frame of reference. It's the eighth colour of the Discworld rainbow, where we might expect ultra-violet, but Discworld light is odd stuff anyway, travelling thousands of times slower than Einstein's standard.

                      So we got the name after this color. This site is dedicated to the ones that think that the magic is almost equaly important to eating. If you are a gamer, reader, Netflix watcher, musician, etc., it means that at least once in your life you met something from the fantasy world. 

                      There you can find a lot of intresting posts that will help you discover the world of FANTASY! 

                      Creatures, places, objects, symbols.. etc. You can find here anything. If something is missing, do not hesitate to tell us and we will search for it. 

                      Welcome to Octarine! A place that brings together so many people just by the power of magic. </p>
